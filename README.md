# Matching Service - Order Book Engine (Java + Spring Boot)

This service implements a basic **Order Matching Engine** for a centralized exchange (CEX), inspired by [philipperemy/Order-Book-Matching-Engine](https://github.com/philipperemy/Order-Book-Matching-Engine).
**Note:** This project is **for learning purposes only** and is currently **under development**. It is **not suitable for production** use. The core matching logic works, but many features are still being implemented or tested.

## Educational Goals

- Understand the inner workings of an order book
- Learn how to manage bid/ask levels using Java collections
- Practice using Spring Boot for service layer integration
- Explore multithreading, synchronization, and basic market logic

## Tech Stack
